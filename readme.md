# Angular 2 Starter Point
This is my new ground-zero for frontend development solutions.

It should use sass or stylus (a better way would be to use both) and a component based approach for styles. Like a general styles somewhere maybe the mixins and functions somewhere else so each individual component would get its own kind of mixins.

We have to use webpack to learn that shit.

Also give typescript a go.

Let's fucking go!

# Webpack
The whole idea here is to use webpack to budle everything for us and also to have everything testeable.

# Styling
Let's have some global styles with my ground-zero sass file and now each component should have access to the variables, functions and mixins.

Styles should run though the same loaders as my ground-zero sass file (autoprefixer, group-css-media-queries, css-comb)
